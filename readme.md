## Zombie Runner

The ultimate endless runner - involving Zombies, Laser guns, Katanas & Tanks.


**Points to remember during development**

- [ ] Move the ground, and not the player (issues when position > 100000)
- [ ] Reposition world elements instead of instantiating them in run time
- [ ] Try "object pooling"
